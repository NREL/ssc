 * CMGeothermalCosts tests the cmod_geothermal_costs. SAM code generator cannot be used to generate data for this module since it is
 * a derived cmod of cmod_geothermal. This means that all the data required to run this cmod is a subset of data created using SAM
 * code generator. The geothermal_costs_default() function in "../input_cases/geothermal_costs_common_data.h" is a data container for the 
 * data used in this particular cmod (which was obatined using the code generator). 
 * Eventually a method can be written to write this data to a vartable so that lower-level methods of pvsamv1 can be tested
 * For now, this uses the SSCAPI interfaces to run the compute module and compare results
