/**
* \class BatteryPowerFlow
*
* \brief
*
*  The BatteryPowerFlow class provides the calculations for which components of the system power flow to/from the battery,
*  which power components go to meet the electric load, and how the utility grid is used.  It is meant to be shared by
*  the lib_power_electronics charge controllers, which require AC power calculations, and the battery dispatch model, 
*  which require DC power calculations.  The interaction of this model with other's may seem complex, but the general
*  design of the battery model is:
*
*  1. ChargeController - contains information about conversion efficiencies and configuration, which is passed to BatteryPowerFlow
*  2. Dispatch - contains information about the dispatch strategy desired, and constraints around when the battery can
*				 charge or discharge, and constraints around the state-of-charge, power and current throughput limits
*				 Within the Dispatch, the following steps are taken:
*				 a) Calculate battery power given the dispatch strategy and contraints
*				 b) Dispatch the battery with that power (current)
*				 c) Iterate on the current (due to the nonlinear relationship in P = IV) until the constraints are met
*				 d) Calculate the final power flow for the time step.
