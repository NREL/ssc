*	time and location passed to the function based on the Astronomical
*	Almanac's Algorithm for the period 1950-2050. For data averaged over an
*	interval, the appropriate time passed is the midpoint of the interval.
*	(Example: For hourly data averaged from 10 to 11, the time passed to the
*	function should be 10 hours and 30 minutes). The exception is when the time
*	interval includes a sunrise or sunset. For these intervals, the appropriate
*	time should be the midpoint of the portion of the interval when the sun is
*	above the horizon. (Example: For hourly data averaged from 7 to 8 with a
*	sunrise time of 7:30, the time passed to the function should be 7 hours and
